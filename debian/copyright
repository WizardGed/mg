fgetln.c

    I found this file here:
    http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/bsd/bsd-current/00library/fgetln.c
    Alas it contained no copyright notice. In the same dir there
    was the following note though. So please don't sue me for
    changing things a bit. I also would have sent the updates if I
    could have found your email. But I didn't.

    for Mg version 2a, mainly the name change from MicroGnuEmacs to
    Mg.
